    "Definition: A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that usually extends the behavior of the original function.\n",

    "Application: Decorators are applied to functions using the @decorator_name syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution: When the decorated function is called, it executes the additional code in the decorator.\n",

    "Generators:\n",

    "Definition: A generator is a function that returns an iterator. It is defined like a regular function but uses yield to return values one at a time.\n",

    "Usage: Generators are used in loops or can be manually iterated using next().\n",
    "\n",
    "State: Each yield saves the state of the function, allowing it to resume from where it left off on subsequent calls."
